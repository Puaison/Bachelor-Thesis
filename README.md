## üìñ Overview
This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Information Engineering. Snippets of the most important part of the project are shown in the [PDF of the thesis](https://github.com/Puaison/Bachelor-Thesis/blob/main/Tesi%20-%20Luca%20Del%20Signore.pdf) (mostly in chapter 6). Moreover, to learn more about the use cases, technologies, design choices and modeling, please refer to the thesis. Here I will give an introduction and a brief overview of the whole project. ‚ö†Ô∏è The thesis and the project are in Italian.

The goal was to **restructure and redesign an existing web software** for the company "[Data Project Engineering](http://www.dataprojectengineering.com/index.php), introducing modern technologies and new architectural models, with a specific focus on the **table management module** for restaurants and retail environments with intuitive UI.

The software was designed following the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and easier future extensions.  
The chosen **architectural design pattern** was **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** to guarantee a clear separation between UI, business logic, and data models.

I worked on the **full stack of the software** (top-down approach), including both front-end and back-end development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **C#** with **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**  
  ‚Üí Compatible with Windows 10, Mobile, Xbox One, and Hololens  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  ‚Üí Encapsulation, modularity, and reusability of components  
- **MVVM Design Pattern**  
  ‚Üí Disconnection of UI from business logic, enabling parallel development  
- **Entity Framework (EF)**  
  ‚Üí Object-relational mapper with LINQ queries and database abstraction  
- **XAML UI Development**  
  ‚Üí Adaptive design for different screen sizes and touch inputs
